### **Git Conventions**

> Make sure you adhere to [Our convention](./5.%20Developing/Conventions/readme.md) for your commits and PR.
> The following is how we categorize the commits/work:
>
> - _Feature_ - a new guideline we've added (Predix, `feat:`)
> - _Fix_ - some corrections, something that was overlooked but not a new change in standards, that will be a feature too eg. typo, etc (Prefix, `fix:`)

### Releases

This is a living document, therefore there will be continuous improvements made on it from time to time, both major and minor. Here are some of the guidelines on how to make releases for this document.

#### How to Release

- Create release notes as per the [guide here](./8.%20Production/Production%20Checklist/readme.md)
- See [release template here](./.github/RELEASE_TEMPLATE.md).
- **Versioning:** our versioning will following the [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org) convention:

  ```
  Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

  MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
  MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
  PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.
  ```

- Once the release note is created, these changes are supposed to be communicated to the teams via the major communication channels: Email (list) and Slack.

#### When to Release

- The recommended frequency for releases is **quarterly**, but this is not cast in stone.
