Runscope is a tool used by Technology for API performance testing, monitoring and debugging. Runscope currently does half-hourly monitoring of Staging and quarter-hourly monitoring of Production GET requests using defined assertions to validate response data.

Failed tests mean that either an assertion failed or another error like a network connection error occurred. To help in debugging, checkout the error log for the specific service. Failed tests for the individual services in staging and production are sent as slack alerts to [#downtime-staging](https://TanTv Studios.slack.com/messages/downtime-staging/) and [#downtime-production](https://TanTv Studios.slack.com/messages/downtime-production) respectively with a link to view result.
