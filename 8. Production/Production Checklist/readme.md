We have found that a short checklist is valuable when setting up a new production environment or preparing for a launch:

- Are we using SSL for Web applications?
- Are we following our default [structure](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HJnk8cqvblyW6NOGN6xkSsWVvtMmYBrumfXN145ZTL4/edit#heading=h.gdbmzxpjdr5r) for microservices?
- Are long-running processes being run in [background jobs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HJnk8cqvblyW6NOGN6xkSsWVvtMmYBrumfXN145ZTL4/edit#heading=h.kr4s147l12xl)?
- Is config stored in environment variables?
- Are we sending logs to Stackdriver with the [epic logger](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@TanTv Studios/logger) library?
- Are we tracking errors with bugsnag?
- Are we monitoring performance and uptime with datadog?
- Are we monitoring new API endpoint in runscope?
- Are we auditing all edit actions in the service? Example [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HJnk8cqvblyW6NOGN6xkSsWVvtMmYBrumfXN145ZTL4/edit#heading=h.qwit764xu5h)
- Are we backing up our production database?
- If releasing a new version, have we run all needed regression tests at the application level?
- Is the test suite running on CI?
- Does the repository have a clear readme, relevant badges and pull request checks setup (CircleCI, CodeClimate)?
