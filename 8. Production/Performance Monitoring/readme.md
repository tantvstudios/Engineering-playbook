**Interpreting service errors**

A peak in error rate is indicative of a problem with the service. To troubleshoot this, check for the error in the service or traces page and follow up on Stackdriver logs on GCP(Google Cloud Platform). Refer to Bugsnag errors as well for more detail. Slack alerts from this monitor are sent to [#devops-alerts](https://TanTv Studios.slack.com/messages/devops-alerts).
